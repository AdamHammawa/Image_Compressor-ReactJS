# Getting Started with the Image Compression App

This project was developed with love, and the idea came about while I was filling an online form and hard to struggle to upload images because of the restrictions on the required kilobytes. I had to look every where for an easy to use website or app to compress my images. So I decided to come up with my own solution.

## Technologies Used

In this project I used front_end Technologies like:

### `ReactJs`
### `Javascript`
### `Html`
### `CSS`


#Runs the app in the deployed mode here.
